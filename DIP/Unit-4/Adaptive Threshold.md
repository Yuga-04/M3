# ⭐ **Basic Adaptive Thresholding Process in Image Segmentation (13 Marks)**

Thresholding is one of the most widely used image segmentation techniques because it converts a grayscale image into a **binary image**, separating objects from background based on intensity.
When the lighting or contrast varies across the image, **Global Thresholding fails**.
In such cases, **Adaptive Thresholding** (also called *variable thresholding*) is used.

---

# ⭐ 1. **Need for Adaptive Thresholding**

In real-world images:

* Illumination is uneven
* Background brightness may vary
* Object and background intensities overlap
* Noise distorts the histogram

Therefore, a **single global threshold** cannot segment the entire image correctly.
Adaptive thresholding solves this by determining a **different threshold for each pixel** based on local neighborhood properties.

---

# ⭐ 2. **Basic Idea of Adaptive Thresholding**

Adaptive thresholding computes a threshold **T(x, y)** individually for each pixel using local statistics such as:

* **Local mean** intensity
* **Local standard deviation**
* **Local contrast**

The image is divided into small neighborhoods (S_{xy}) around each pixel, and threshold is calculated from these local properties.

---

# ⭐ 3. **Local Neighborhood Approach (From PDF)**

For a given pixel at ((x,y)):

Let

* ( m_{xy} ) = **local mean** intensity of neighborhood (S_{xy})
* ( \sigma_{xy} ) = **local standard deviation** in the neighborhood

The adaptive threshold is defined as:

Where:

* ( a, b ) = constant parameters
* Threshold varies from location to location

This formula is directly from the PDF content.

# ⭐ 4. **Adaptive Segmentation Rule**

Once the threshold is computed, segmentation is done as:

Thus:

* Pixels brighter than the local threshold become **object (1)**.
* Pixels darker become **background (0)**.

---

# ⭐ 5. **Two Basic Approaches to Adaptive Thresholding**

According to the PDF, adaptive thresholding can be done in two ways:

---

## **A) Image Partitioning (Block-based Thresholding)**

* The image is divided into **non-overlapping rectangular blocks**.
* Each block is treated like a separate image.
* A **global thresholding method** (simple threshold or Otsu’s method) is applied to each block.

✔ Useful when the full image histogram is corrupted by noise
✔ Local histograms show clearer bimodal patterns
✔ Threshold adapts to varying lighting in different regions

---

## **B) Pixel-wise Adaptive Thresholding (Neighborhood-based)**

This is the **most general and flexible approach**.

* For each pixel, a neighborhood (3×3, 5×5, 7×7 etc.) is selected.
* Compute **local mean and standard deviation**.
* Threshold generated for each pixel individually.

✔ Works very well when image contains complex illumination changes
✔ Can separate objects with subtle intensity differences

---

# ⭐ 6. **Example (From PDF Explanation)**

Consider an image where:

* Left region is bright
* Right region is dark
* Object intensity slightly varies across the image

**Global thresholding fails** because one threshold cannot correctly separate objects in both regions.

Using adaptive thresholding:

* In bright areas, the local mean is high → threshold becomes high
* In dark areas, local mean is low → threshold becomes low

Thus each part of the image gets a **locally optimized threshold**, giving correct segmentation.

---

# ⭐ 7. **Advantages of Adaptive Thresholding**

✔ Handles **non-uniform illumination**
✔ Works well with **complex backgrounds**
✔ Effective in **medical imaging, document scanning, microscopy**
✔ Produces more accurate segmentation compared to global thresholding
✔ Reduces errors due to lighting gradients

---

# ⭐ 8. **Limitations**

✘ Computationally expensive (threshold calculated for every pixel)
✘ Sensitive to neighborhood size selection
✘ Noise may affect local statistics if not pre-smoothed

---

# ⭐ 9. **Summary (Perfect for 13 Marks)**

Adaptive thresholding is an advanced threshold-based segmentation method used when global thresholding fails due to varying illumination or contrast. It determines a threshold for each pixel based on local neighborhood statistics. The threshold is computed using local mean and standard deviation. Segmentation is then applied using this pixel-level threshold. Two main approaches—block-based partitioning and pixel-wise adaptive thresholding—enable the method to handle images with uneven brightness. It produces accurate segmentation in real-world images and is widely used in medical, industrial, and document image processing.
