# ⭐ **Principle of Operation of the Human Eye (13-Mark Answer)**

*(Based strictly on your PDF: Elements of Visual Perception)* 

The **human eye** works like a **camera**, where external light entering the eye is focused onto a light-sensitive surface called the **retina**. The retina converts the incoming light into neural signals, which are then interpreted by the brain to form visual perception.

Your PDF describes:

* Structure of the eye
* Image formation on the retina
* Role of rods and cones
* Brightness adaptation and discrimination
  We will use these points to write a complete 13-mark answer.

# ⭐ 1. **Structure of the Human Eye**

*(Described from the PDF’s diagram and content)*

The human eye is a **slightly asymmetrical sphere**, approximately **20–25 mm** in diameter and **6.5 cc** in volume.

### **Main parts of the eye:**

### **1. Cornea**

* Transparent, curved surface at the front.
* Performs *most of the refraction* of incoming light.

### **2. Pupil**

* Black circular opening that regulates light entry.
* Contracts in bright light and dilates in dim light.

### **3. Iris**

* The colored part around the pupil.
* Controls pupil size.

### **4. Lens**

* Transparent, flexible structure behind the pupil.
* Adjusts focal length to focus near or far objects (accommodation).

### **5. Anterior Chamber and Fluids**

* Lens, iris, and cornea are nourished by **aqueous fluid**.
* Maintains internal pressure of the eye.

### **6. Retina**

* Light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye.
* Functions like a **camera film / sensor**.

### **7. Optic Nerve**

* Carries signals from retina to the brain.

# ⭐ 2. **Photoreceptors: Rods and Cones**

*(Directly from PDF)* 

### **Cones**

* 6–7 million in number.
* Concentrated in the fovea.
* Responsible for **color vision** and **daylight (photopic) vision**.
* Provide high-resolution vision.

### **Rods**

* 75–150 million.
* Distributed across the retina except the fovea.
* Sensitive to **low illumination levels**.
* Used in **night vision (scotopic vision)**.
* Do NOT detect color.

# ⭐ 3. **Principle of Image Formation in the Eye**

*(Exactly described in the PDF)* 

When light from an object enters the eye:

1. It first passes through the **cornea**, which bends (refracts) light.
2. It then enters through the **pupil**.
3. The **lens** further focuses the light.
4. A sharp, inverted image is formed on the **retina**.
5. The distance between lens and retina is about **17 mm**.
6. The lens adjusts its shape to maintain clear focus on close or distant objects.

### **How the eye works (camera analogy):**

| Eye Component | Camera Equivalent   |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Cornea + Lens | Optical lens        |
| Pupil         | Aperture            |
| Retina        | Image sensor / film |
| Optic nerve   | Data cable          |
| Brain         | Image processor     |

# ⭐ 4. **Conversion of Light to Neural Signals**

Once the image is focused on the retina:

1. **Rods and cones detect photons**.
2. They convert light energy into **electrical impulses**.
3. These impulses are transmitted through **optic nerve fibers**.
4. The brain interprets this electrical data as a **visual image**.

This entire process is the basis of **visual perception**.

---

# ⭐ 5. **Brightness Adaptation and Discrimination**

*(This section is explicitly present in your PDF)* 

The human visual system can adapt to an extremely wide range of light intensities.

### ⭐ **Brightness Adaptation**

* The visual system adapts to the current brightness level.
* This is called **brightness adaptation level**.
* The eye can function over a range of **10¹⁰** in intensity.
* But it cannot operate across such a huge range **simultaneously**.

### ⭐ **Brightness Discrimination**

* Ability to distinguish between small intensity differences.
* Higher background brightness → more intensity difference needed to detect a change.
