Here’s a **15-mark detailed answer** for the question:

**“What input and output devices would you use for the following systems? For each, compare and contrast alternatives, and if appropriate indicate why the conventional keyboard, mouse, and CRT screen may be less suitable.”**

---

## **Answer**

Different systems require input and output devices that match their **operational environment**, **user needs**, and **mobility requirements**.
Below is a detailed explanation for each system with suitable device choices and reasoning.

---

### **(a) Portable Word Processor**  *(2.5 Marks)*

**Input Devices:**

* **Voice Input:** For dictation and hands-free use.

**Output Devices:**

* **LCD / LED Screen:** Lightweight, low power consumption.
* **Thermal Printer (optional):** For on-the-go printing.

**Why not conventional keyboard, mouse, CRT:**

* **Keyboard and mouse** are bulky for portable use.
* **CRT screens** are heavy and consume more power; unsuitable for battery-powered devices.

---

### **(b) Tourist Information System**  *(2.5 Marks)*

**Input Devices:**

* **Touchscreen Interface:** Intuitive for general public use.
* **Microphone (voice commands):** For multilingual tourists.
* **Card Reader / QR Scanner:** For accessing tourist passes or tickets.

**Output Devices:**

* **Large LCD Display / Kiosk Screen:** Displays maps, routes, attractions.
* **Speakers:** Provide voice-based guidance.
* **Printers (optional):** Print maps or guides.

**Why not keyboard, mouse, CRT:**

* Tourists are casual users—**keyboard/mouse increase complexity**.
* **Touchscreen** is more user-friendly and supports multiple languages.
* **CRT screens** are outdated and unsuitable for public kiosks.

---

### **(c) Tractor-Mounted Crop-Spraying Controller**  *(2.5 Marks)*

**Input Devices:**

* **Touchpad or Rugged Buttons:** Can be operated while wearing gloves.
* **GPS Sensors:** Input for vehicle position and spray zones.
* **Joystick / Knobs:** For manual control of spray direction.

**Output Devices:**

* **Sunlight-readable LCD Display:** Shows spray rate, area covered.
* **Audible Alerts / LEDs:** Warn operator of malfunctions.

**Why not keyboard, mouse, CRT:**

* Environment is **dusty and vibrating**—keyboard/mouse not durable.
* **Touch or physical buttons** are easier for field conditions.
* **CRT** unsuitable due to vibration, size, and power use.

---

### **(d) Air Traffic Control System**  *(2.5 Marks)*

**Input Devices:**

* **Trackball / Light Pen:** For precise selection on radar displays.
* **Touchscreen Panels:** For flight route adjustments.
* **Microphone / Headset:** For communication with pilots.

**Output Devices:**

* **High-resolution Radar Display:** To show real-time aircraft positions.
* **Alphanumeric Display / LED Panels:** For flight details.
* **Audio Alerts:** For collision warnings or system failures.

**Why not keyboard, mouse, CRT:**

* **Keyboard/mouse** are too slow for rapid, continuous tracking.
* **Trackball and light pen** allow quick, precise pointing.
* **CRT displays** can cause flicker and eye strain during long shifts.

---

### **(e) Worldwide Personal Communications System**  *(2.5 Marks)*

**Input Devices:**

* **Microphone / Touchscreen:** For calls and messages.
* **Camera:** For video conferencing and document sharing.
* **Soft Keyboard / Voice Recognition:** For global multilingual input.

**Output Devices:**

* **OLED / LCD Screen:** For high clarity and low power.
* **Speakers / Earphones:** For voice output.
* **Haptic Feedback:** For notifications and alerts.

**Why not keyboard, mouse, CRT:**

* System must be **compact and portable**—keyboard and CRT impractical.
* **Touch and voice input** are more natural for mobile communication.

---

### **(f) Digital Cartographic System**  *(2.5 Marks)*

**Input Devices:**

* **Graphics Tablet / Stylus:** For drawing and editing maps precisely.
* **Scanner / Digitizer:** For converting paper maps to digital form.
* **Mouse (optional):** For basic navigation.

**Output Devices:**

* **High-resolution Monitor / Large Display:** For detailed map visualization.
* **Plotter / Large-format Printer:** For printing maps.
* **3D Visualization Display (optional):** For terrain modeling.

**Why not keyboard, CRT:**

* **Keyboard** not ideal for graphical editing tasks.
* **CRT** lacks resolution and color accuracy compared to modern LED/IPS displays.
