## üåç Universal Design Principles (20 Marks)

Universal Design refers to the creation of products and environments that are accessible and usable by all people, regardless of age, ability, or status. The following seven principles provide a framework for inclusive design that accommodates the widest possible range of users.

---

### 1. **Equitable Use**
- **Definition:** The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
- **Example:** Automatic doors that serve both wheelchair users and others.
- **Impact:** Promotes inclusivity and avoids stigmatization.

---

### 2. **Flexibility in Use**
- **Definition:** The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
- **Example:** Adjustable font sizes, voice and touch input options.
- **Impact:** Enhances personalization and accessibility.

---

### 3. **Simple and Intuitive Use**
- **Definition:** The design is easy to understand, regardless of the user‚Äôs experience, knowledge, or concentration level.
- **Example:** ATM interfaces with clear instructions and minimal steps.
- **Impact:** Reduces cognitive load and supports diverse literacy levels.

---

### 4. **Perceptible Information**
- **Definition:** The design communicates necessary information effectively, regardless of sensory abilities or environmental conditions.
- **Example:** Traffic signals with both visual and auditory cues.
- **Impact:** Ensures information is accessible to users with sensory impairments.

---

### 5. **Tolerance for Error**
- **Definition:** The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
- **Example:** ‚ÄúUndo‚Äù functions, confirmation prompts before deletion.
- **Impact:** Supports safe usage and reduces user anxiety.

---

### 6. **Low Physical Effort**
- **Definition:** The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimal fatigue.
- **Example:** Ergonomic keyboards, touchless faucets.
- **Impact:** Improves comfort and usability for all users, especially those with physical limitations.

---

### 7. **Size and Space for Approach and Use**
- **Definition:** Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user‚Äôs body size, posture, or mobility.
- **Example:** Wide doorways, adjustable-height workstations.
- **Impact:** Supports accessibility for seated users and those using assistive devices.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion
Universal Design Principles ensure that systems are inclusive, intuitive, and safe for all users. By applying these principles, designers can create environments and interfaces that respect human diversity and promote equal access.
