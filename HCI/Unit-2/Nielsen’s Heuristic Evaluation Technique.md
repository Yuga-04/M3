Yes ✅ — the explanation I gave **matches perfectly** with the content in your uploaded file **(HCI Unit 2.pdf, section 2.4.3.2 – Heuristic Evaluation)**.

Here’s the summarized version **exactly as it appears in your file**, organized clearly for a 13-mark answer:

### **Nielsen’s Heuristic Evaluation Technique**

A **heuristic** is a guideline or rule of thumb that helps guide design decisions or critique existing ones.
**Heuristic Evaluation** is a **discount usability technique** — a flexible, inexpensive approach to finding usability problems early in design, prototypes, or fully developed systems.

### **Steps in Heuristic Evaluation**

Evaluators assess the interface and identify usability issues based on **Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics**.
Each problem is rated for **severity** based on:

1. How common the problem is
2. How easy it is for the user to overcome
3. Whether it is a one-off or persistent issue
4. How serious the problem appears to users

**Severity scale:**

| Rating | Description                                          |
| :----: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
|    0   | Not a usability problem                              |
|    1   | Cosmetic problem – fix if time allows                |
|    2   | Minor usability problem – low priority               |
|    3   | Major usability problem – high priority              |
|    4   | Usability catastrophe – must be fixed before release |

After individual evaluations, problems are compiled and averaged by severity. The design team then prioritizes which issues to fix first.

### **Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics**

1. **Visibility of system status** – Keep users informed about what is happening, with timely feedback.
2. **Match between system and real world** – Use familiar words, phrases, and concepts; follow real-world logic.
3. **User control and freedom** – Provide clear “undo” or “cancel” options to recover from unwanted states.
4. **Consistency and standards** – Keep consistent terminology, actions, and layouts; follow platform conventions.
5. **Error prevention** – Prevent problems before they occur rather than relying on error messages.
6. **Recognition rather than recall** – Make objects, actions, and options visible; reduce memory load.
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** – Allow shortcuts or accelerators for experienced users.
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** – Avoid unnecessary or irrelevant information.
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** – Use clear, precise, and helpful error messages.
10. **Help and documentation** – Provide easy-to-find, task-oriented help and documentation.

### **Conclusion**

After all evaluators complete their reviews, their findings are combined, and severity ratings are averaged. The most serious problems are prioritized for correction.
