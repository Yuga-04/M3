## ðŸ§© Normanâ€™s Seven Principles of User-Centered Design (20 Marks)

Donald Normanâ€™s principles focus on simplifying complex tasks by aligning system design with human cognitive capabilities. These principles are foundational in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and guide designers in creating intuitive, error-resistant interfaces.

---

### 1. **Use Both Knowledge in the World and Knowledge in the Head**
- **Explanation:** External cues (labels, icons, constraints) help users perform tasks without relying solely on memory. Experts benefit from internalized knowledge for efficiency.
- **Example:** A calculator with labeled buttons (external) vs. a user who memorizes key sequences (internal).
- **Impact:** Supports both novice and expert users by balancing visibility and learnability.

---

### 2. **Simplify the Structure of Tasks**
- **Explanation:** Break down complex tasks into manageable steps to reduce cognitive load and problem-solving effort.
- **Example:** Step-by-step wizards for software installation.
- **Impact:** Enhances usability and reduces user errors.

---

### 3. **Make Things Visible**
- **Explanation:** The interface should clearly show available actions and system status, bridging the gulfs of execution (what to do) and evaluation (what happened).
- **Example:** Highlighted buttons, real-time feedback, visible progress indicators.
- **Impact:** Improves transparency and user confidence.

---

### 4. **Get the Mappings Right**
- **Explanation:** Controls should intuitively correspond to their effects. The physical layout and behavior should match user expectations.
- **Example:** Volume knob turning clockwise increases sound; sliders with proportional movement.
- **Impact:** Reduces confusion and speeds up learning.

---

### 5. **Exploit the Power of Constraints**
- **Explanation:** Use physical, logical, or cultural constraints to guide correct usage and prevent errors.
- **Example:** USB plugs fit only one way; form fields with input masks.
- **Impact:** Encourages correct behavior and simplifies decision-making.

---

### 6. **Design for Error**
- **Explanation:** Anticipate user mistakes and provide mechanisms for recovery.
- **Example:** Undo buttons, confirmation dialogs, error messages with guidance.
- **Impact:** Reduces frustration and supports resilience.

---

### 7. **When All Else Fails, Standardize**
- **Explanation:** If natural mappings arenâ€™t possible, use consistent standards so users only need to learn once.
- **Example:** Standard keyboard layouts, car control placements.
- **Impact:** Promotes familiarity and reduces learning curve across systems.

---

### âœ… Conclusion
Normanâ€™s principles emphasize clarity, simplicity, and error tolerance. By aligning system behavior with human cognition and expectations, designers can transform complex tasks into intuitive experiences. These principles are essential for building user-friendly, efficient, and reliable interfaces.
