Here’s the exact explanation from your **HCI Unit 3 PDF** (page 13–14) for the **stages involved in CUSTOM Methodology analysis**, rewritten neatly for a **13-mark exam answer** 👇

## **CUSTOM Methodology – Six Stages of Analysis**

**CUSTOM** (Commonly Used Socio-Technical Organizational Methodology)
is a **socio-technical methodology** designed to be practical for use in **small organizations**.
It focuses mainly on **stakeholders** and their interaction with the system.

---

### **Stage 1 – Describe the Organizational Context**

* Define the **primary goals**, **physical characteristics**, **political**, and **economic background** of the organization.
* Helps in understanding how the organization functions and what factors affect it.

---

### **Stage 2 – Identify and Describe Stakeholders**

* All **stakeholders** are listed and categorized as:

  * **Primary**, **Secondary**, **Tertiary**, or **Facilitating**.
* Each stakeholder is described in terms of:

  * Personal issues
  * Role in the organization
  * Job responsibilities

---

### **Stage 3 – Identify and Describe Work-Groups**

* A **work-group** refers to any group of people who work together on a task (formally or informally).
* Each group is described by:

  * Its **role** within the organization
  * Its **characteristics** (skills, interaction, workflow)

---

### **Stage 4 – Identify and Describe Task–Object Pairs**

* Identify **tasks** that must be performed and the **objects** used to perform them.
* Helps to understand **how people interact with tools or systems** during their work.

---

### **Stage 5 – Identify Stakeholder Needs**

* Based on Stages **2–4**, describe both the **current system** and the **proposed system**.
* **Compare** the two to determine:

  * What changes are needed
  * What **stakeholder needs** must be met in the new system

---

### **Stage 6 – Consolidate and Check Stakeholder Requirements**

* Review all identified **needs and requirements**.
* Check them against earlier criteria to ensure:

  * No conflicts
  * All priorities are clear
  * The new system satisfies stakeholder goals

---

### **Additional Note:**

Stages **2–4** are analyzed for both:

* The **current situation** (before new technology) and
* The **proposed situation** (after new technology).

Stakeholders express their **current roles** and **future expectations**, helping to understand the **impact of new technology** and necessary transformations for successful system deployment.

### **Conclusion**

The CUSTOM methodology provides a **systematic, stakeholder-focused approach** to analyze both technical and social factors before system implementation.
It ensures the **system fits organizational goals** and **meets user needs effectively**.
