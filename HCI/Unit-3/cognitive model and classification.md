## **Q: What is a Cognitive Model? Classify cognitive models and discuss the same. With a text editor example, explain the Cognitive Complexity Theory. (13 Marks)**

---

### **1. Introduction**

In **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)**, a **cognitive model** represents how users **think, perceive, remember, and decide** while interacting with a computer system.
It helps designers understand the **mental processes** involved in performing tasks, predicting user behavior, and improving usability.

**Definition:**
A **cognitive model** is a theoretical representation of the human thought process used to explain and predict user interactions with computer systems.

---

### **2. Classification of Cognitive Models**

Cognitive models are classified into the following major types:

1. **Linguistic Models:**

   * Based on language and communication between user and system.
   * Example: Natural Language Interfaces.

2. **Rule-Based Models:**

   * Use a set of **if–then rules** to simulate user reasoning.
   * Example: ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought – Rational).

3. **Information Processing Models:**

   * Treat human cognition like a computer system that processes information in stages: perception → memory → decision → response.
   * Example: Model Human Processor (MHP).

4. **Predictive Models:**

   * Used to **predict user performance** such as task completion time or error rates.
   * Example: GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection Rules), Keystroke-Level Model (KLM).

5. **Computational Models:**

   * Simulate actual cognitive behavior through programs.
   * Example: SOAR or EPIC cognitive architectures.

---

### **3. Discussion of Key Models**

* **GOMS Model:**
  Breaks a task into Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules.
  Helps estimate how long a user will take to perform a task.

* **KLM Model:**
  Focuses on low-level actions like keystrokes or mouse movements to predict performance time.

* **Model Human Processor:**
  Represents the user as having perceptual, cognitive, and motor processors with specific cycle times.

### **4. Cognitive Complexity Theory (CCT)**

**Definition:**
Cognitive Complexity Theory explains that **the more mentally complex a system or task is, the harder it is for users to learn and perform it efficiently.**

It focuses on the **mental workload** (cognitive load) required to operate a system and how interface design can reduce it.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **Cognitive complexity:** Effort required to understand and operate the system.
* **Mental model:** User’s internal understanding of how the system works.
* **Usability link:** Simpler interfaces lower cognitive complexity → better performance.

---

### **5. Example: Text Editor Interface**

#### **Simple Text Editor (e.g., Notepad)**

* Few, consistent commands like *Open, Save, Cut, Paste*.
* Easy to predict and remember functions.
* → **Low cognitive complexity.**

#### **Complex Text Editor (e.g., MS Word)**

* Contains menus, ribbons, shortcuts, and advanced formatting options.
* Users need to remember multiple steps and options.
* → **High cognitive complexity.**

**According to CCT:**
Users of Notepad learn and perform tasks faster because the system’s design is simpler.
In contrast, MS Word requires more cognitive effort, so new users take longer to learn.

---

### **6. Design Implications**

To reduce cognitive complexity:

1. Keep the interface **consistent** and **intuitive**.
2. Use **familiar symbols and commands**.
3. Minimize the number of steps for common tasks.
4. Provide **clear feedback** for each user action.
5. Group related functions logically.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

Cognitive models help designers understand how users think and interact with systems.
By applying **Cognitive Complexity Theory**, designers can reduce mental workload and improve usability.
A **simple, consistent, and logical interface** always leads to more efficient and satisfying user interaction.
