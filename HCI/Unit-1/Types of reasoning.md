From your PDF **“HCI Unit 1”**, the relevant section on **Reasoning and Problem Solving** (pp. 10–13) identifies **three main types of reasoning** and explains **how people solve problems** as follows:

---

### **Types of Reasoning**

1. **Deductive Reasoning**

   * **Definition:** It derives logically necessary conclusions from given premises.
   * **Example:**

     * *If it is Friday, then she will go to work.*
       *It is Friday.*
       *Therefore, she will go to work.*
   * **Explanation:** The conclusion follows logically from the premises. However, logical validity does not always mean the statement is *true* in real life. Humans often confuse truth and logical validity, which can lead to reasoning errors.

2. **Inductive Reasoning**

   * **Definition:** It involves generalizing from observed cases to unobserved ones.
   * **Example:**
     If every elephant you have seen has a trunk, you infer that all elephants have trunks.
   * **Explanation:** Induction is not logically certain but probabilistic—it can be disproved by a single counterexample. Despite its unreliability, it is a *key process in learning and forming expectations* about the world.
   * **Note:** People tend to rely on **positive evidence** (confirming examples) rather than negative evidence (disconfirming examples).

3. **Abductive Reasoning**

   * **Definition:** It reasons from an observed fact to the most likely explanation or cause.
   * **Example:**
     If Sam always drives too fast when she’s been drinking, and we see Sam driving too fast, we might infer she has been drinking.
   * **Explanation:** Abduction is used to form hypotheses or explanations. It is often uncertain because alternative causes may exist, but people naturally infer causal relationships this way.
   * **Importance in HCI:** Users infer causal relationships between their actions and system responses (e.g., assuming an action caused an event on screen), which can lead to misunderstandings if the interface is unclear.

### **Problem Solving**

Problem solving is described as the process of **finding a solution to an unfamiliar task using available knowledge**. People adapt existing information to new situations, showing creativity and insight. The text identifies three major perspectives on how humans solve problems:

---

1. **Gestalt Theory (Insight-based)**

   * **Key Idea:** Problem solving involves both **reproductive** (based on past experience) and **productive** (involving new insight) thinking.
   * **Example:** Maier’s *pendulum problem* showed that participants gained insight when they saw a string moving, helping them realize how to tie two distant strings together.
   * **Concept:** Sometimes, old knowledge can block new insight — a problem known as **fixation**.

---

2. **Problem Space Theory (Newell & Simon, 1970s)**

   * **Key Idea:** The human mind is viewed as a **limited information processor** navigating a “problem space.”
   * **Structure:**

     * **Initial state** → **Goal state**
     * **Operators:** Actions that transform one state into another.
   * **Heuristics:** People use strategies like **means–ends analysis**—reducing the difference between the current and goal state by creating subgoals.
   * **Example:** To move a desk from one wall to another, you might first remove drawers (subgoal: make desk lighter), then move it.
   * **Implication:** Experience helps structure the problem space efficiently.

---

3. **Analogical Reasoning**

   * **Definition:** Using knowledge from a similar, known domain to solve a new problem (called **analogical mapping**).
   * **Example:** Gick and Holyoak’s experiment:

     * *Tumor problem* → solved using an *army and fortress analogy* (small forces converge from different paths to overcome a barrier).
   * **Outcome:** Problem solving improves when analogies are recognized and applied correctly.

| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Deductive Reasoning**        | Logical derivation from known facts                 | “If it’s Friday, she will work.”         |
| **Inductive Reasoning**        | Generalization from specific examples               | “All elephants have trunks.”             |
| **Abductive Reasoning**        | Inferring best explanation for an observation       | “Sam drives fast → She’s been drinking.” |
| **Gestalt Theory**             | Problem solving through insight                     | Maier’s pendulum problem                 |
| **Problem Space Theory**       | Stepwise solution using heuristics                  | Means–ends analysis                      |
| **Analogical Problem Solving** | Solving new problems using similar past experiences | Tumor–fortress analogy                   |

**In conclusion:**
People solve problems using reasoning processes—deduction (logic), induction (generalization), and abduction (explanation)—and apply different strategies such as **insight**, **heuristic search**, and **analogy** to arrive at solutions. Expertise and experience improve efficiency by allowing the brain to structure and navigate the problem space effectively.
