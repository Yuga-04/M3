## **HUMAN MEMORY ‚Äî (40 MARKS)**

### **Introduction**

Human memory is a vital aspect of Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction (HCI). It determines how users learn, remember, and perform tasks while interacting with computer systems. Understanding how memory functions helps interface designers reduce user errors and improve usability.

---

### **1. Types of Human Memory**

Human memory is divided mainly into **Short-Term Memory (STM)** and **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**.

---

### **1.1 Short-Term Memory (Working Memory)**

#### **Definition:**

Short-term or working memory acts as a temporary **‚Äúscratch pad‚Äù** for quick recall and mental manipulation of information.

#### **Characteristics:**

* **Duration:** Holds information briefly (about **200 milliseconds**).
* **Access time:** Very fast (~70 ms).
* **Capacity:** Limited ‚Äî average person can remember **7 ¬± 2 items** (George Miller‚Äôs rule).
* **Decay:** Information fades quickly unless rehearsed.

#### **Example:**

When calculating **35 √ó 6** in your head, you store intermediate results like (30 √ó 6) and (5 √ó 6) before adding them ‚Äî this uses short-term memory.

#### **HCI Implications:**

* Interfaces must **not overload** user memory.
* Provide **visible options** instead of requiring recall (e.g., menus, tooltips).
* Use **chunking** and **grouping** to help users process information efficiently.
* Keep **commands, icons, and layouts** consistent.

---

### **1.2 Long-Term Memory**

#### **Definition:**

Long-term memory is the **permanent storehouse** for knowledge, facts, experiences, and procedural rules.

#### **Characteristics:**

* **Capacity:** Huge or unlimited.
* **Access Time:** Slower (~0.1 second).
* **Forgetting:** Occurs slowly, if at all.
* **Transfer:** Information is moved from STM to LTM through **rehearsal** and **meaningful learning**.

#### **Contents of Long-Term Memory:**

1. **Episodic Memory:**

   * Stores personal experiences and events in chronological order.
   * Example: Remembering when you first used a software tool.

2. **Semantic Memory:**

   * Stores facts, concepts, and meanings.
   * Structured as **semantic networks**, where related ideas are linked (e.g., ‚Äúdog‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúanimal‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúpet‚Äù).
   * Can also be represented using **frames** (structured templates with attributes) and **scripts** (stereotypical sequences of events).

3. **Procedural Memory:**

   * Stores knowledge of **how to perform tasks**.
   * Represented using **production rules** (if‚Äìthen statements).
   * Example:

     * IF dog wags tail ‚Üí THEN pat dog
     * IF dog growls ‚Üí THEN move away

---

### **2. Long-Term Memory Processes**

#### **(a) Storage (Remembering)**

* Information is transferred from STM to LTM through **rehearsal**.
* Repetition improves storage ‚Äî known as the **Total Time Hypothesis (Ebbinghaus)**.
* **Distributed practice** (spreading learning over time) is more effective than continuous practice.

**Example:**
Typing learners who practiced 1 hour per week remembered better than those who practiced 4 hours at once.

* **Meaningful Information** is stored more easily than random data.

  * Example: Easier to remember ‚Äúboat, tree, cat‚Äù (visual objects) than ‚Äúfaith, logic, idea‚Äù (abstract concepts).

---

#### **(b) Forgetting**

There are **two major theories of forgetting**:

1. **Decay Theory:**

   * Memory fades over time if not reinforced.
   * **Ebbinghaus‚Äô forgetting curve** shows rapid initial decay, then slower loss.
   * **Jost‚Äôs Law:** Older memory traces are more durable than newer ones.

2. **Interference Theory:**

   * New information can displace old information.

     * **Retroactive interference:** New information overwrites old.
       *Example:* Forgetting your old phone number after learning a new one.
     * **Proactive inhibition:** Old memories interfere with new learning.
       *Example:* Typing an old password by mistake.

---

#### **(c) Retrieval**

Retrieval is the process of recalling stored information. It can be of two types:

1. **Recall:**

   * Retrieving information without external help.
   * Example: Typing a command from memory.

2. **Recognition:**

   * Identifying information when presented.
   * Example: Selecting a familiar icon or option from a menu.
   * Recognition is easier than recall ‚Äî hence, **interfaces should support recognition** (e.g., showing recent files).

**Retrieval Cues:**
Memory recall is improved by cues like **categories** or **grouping**.
Words organized by meaning are easier to recall than random ones.

### **3. Knowledge Representation in Memory**

| **Representation Type** | **Description**                                       | **Example in HCI**                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Semantic Networks**   | Linked nodes representing relationships between ideas | ‚ÄúDog‚Äù linked to ‚Äúanimal‚Äù, ‚Äúpet‚Äù, ‚Äúbarks‚Äù             |
| **Frames**              | Data structures with slots and attributes             | ‚ÄúDog‚Äù frame with slots: type, color, owner           |
| **Scripts**             | Represent routine sequences of events                 | ‚ÄúVisiting a vet‚Äù ‚Äî enter, examine, treat, pay, leave |
| **Production Rules**    | IF‚ÄìTHEN procedural knowledge                          | IF error occurs THEN show alert                      |

### **4. Implications of Human Memory in HCI Design**

Designing user interfaces with memory limitations in mind leads to better usability. Key principles:

1. **Reduce Memory Load:**

   * Keep essential information visible.
   * Use icons, menus, and wizards.

2. **Recognition Over Recall:**

   * Users should recognize options instead of memorizing commands.

3. **Consistency:**

   * Uniform layouts and controls aid procedural memory.

4. **Feedback and Error Recovery:**

   * Provide immediate feedback and undo options.

5. **Chunking and Grouping:**

   * Organize information into meaningful clusters.

6. **Use Familiar Concepts:**

   * Apply real-world metaphors like folders, trash bins, or desktops.

---

### **5. Summary**

* **Short-term memory** ‚Äì temporary storage (fast, small capacity).
* **Long-term memory** ‚Äì permanent store (large capacity, slower access).
* **Processes:** storage, forgetting, retrieval.
* **Forgetting** occurs by decay or interference.
* **Design implication:** Support recognition, minimize memory demand, and provide cues.

---

### **Conclusion**

Human memory is the foundation of how users interact with systems. By understanding its types, limitations, and processes, HCI designers can create intuitive, efficient, and error-free interfaces that align with human cognitive abilities.
A well-designed system should **support human memory**, not burden it.
