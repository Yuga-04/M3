## **Human I/O Channels**

Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) involves communication between humans and computers through **input** and **output** channels.

* **Input**: Information received by humans through senses.
* **Output**: Actions performed via effectors (muscles, speech, movements).
  In HCI, a user’s output becomes the computer’s input, and vice versa. For example, **sight** is primarily used to receive information but can also provide input in systems like eye-gaze tracking.

### **Human Input Channels**

1. **Five Senses**

   * **Sight** (primary for HCI), **hearing**, **touch** are dominant.
   * **Taste** and **smell** have minimal HCI roles.
2. **Effectors**

   * Limbs, fingers, eyes, head, and voice; in computers, fingers (keyboard/mouse) dominate.

## **Vision** (Primary Input Channel)

**Stages:**

1. **Physical Reception** – Eye receives light reflected from objects.
2. **Processing & Interpretation** – Brain analyzes patterns, depth, color, brightness.

**Eye Structure:**

* **Cornea & Lens** focus image on **retina**.
* **Rods** – Highly light-sensitive, low detail, no color, active in dim light.
* **Cones** – Color vision (red, green, blue sensitive), concentrated in **fovea**.
* **Blind Spot** – No receptors where optic nerve exits.
* **Ganglion Cells** –

  * X-cells detect patterns.
  * Y-cells detect movement.

**Visual Perception:**

* **Size & Depth** – Determined by **visual angle** (depends on size & distance).
* **Brightness** – Related to **luminance** and **contrast**. Rods dominate in dim light, cones in normal light.
* **Color** – Defined by:

  * Hue (wavelength)
  * Intensity (brightness)
  * Saturation (purity)
    ~7 million colors can be perceived.

**Limitations & Illusions:** Size constancy can cause illusions (e.g., Ponzo illusion).

## **Reading**

* Eye makes **saccades** (jerky movements) and **fixations** (94% of reading time).
* **Regressions** occur in complex text.
* Adults read ~250 words/minute.
* Legibility depends on font size (9–12pt) and line length (2.3–5.2 inches).

## **Hearing**

**Ear Structure:**

* Outer ear – Protection, amplifies sound.
* Middle ear – Transmits vibrations.
* Inner ear – Converts vibrations to nerve signals.

**Sound Properties:**

* **Pitch** (frequency), **loudness** (amplitude), **timbre** (quality).
* Range: 20 Hz – 15 kHz.
* **Auditory filtering** enables focusing on specific sounds (e.g., cocktail party effect).

---

## **Touch (Haptic Perception)**

* Provides environmental feedback (heat, pain, pressure).
* Important for visually impaired users.
* **Receptors:**

  * Thermoreceptors (temperature)
  * Nociceptors (pain)
  * Mechanoreceptors (pressure) – rapid or slow adapting.

---

## **Movement**

* Sequence: **Stimulus → Brain processing → Muscle response**.
* **Reaction Time:** Auditory (~150 ms) < Visual (~200 ms) < Pain (~700 ms).
* Governed by **Fitts’ Law**:
  [
  MT = a + b \log_2\left(\frac{distance}{size} + 1\right)
  ]
  (Movement Time depends on target size & distance.)

## **Human Memory**

**1. Short-Term Memory (STM)**

* Temporary store (~200 ms), capacity ~7 ± 2 items, very fast access (~70 ms).
* Used for intermediate processing (e.g., mental calculations).

**2. Long-Term Memory (LTM)**

* Large capacity, slower access (~0.1s), minimal decay.
* Information stored via rehearsal.

**Types of LTM:**

* **Episodic Memory** – Events & experiences.
* **Semantic Memory** – Facts, concepts, skills (structured as semantic networks, frames, and scripts).
* **Procedural Memory** – How to perform tasks (condition–action rules).

---

✅ **Summary:**
Human I/O channels in HCI involve sensory inputs (vision, hearing, touch) and motor outputs (limbs, speech). Vision is the most critical, involving complex physical reception and interpretation. Hearing and touch add multimodal feedback. Movement and memory processes (STM & LTM) affect interaction speed, accuracy, and learning in system use. Understanding these capabilities and limitations is crucial for designing efficient, user-friendly interfaces.
