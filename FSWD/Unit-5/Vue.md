# *VUE.JS and VUEX (13 Marks)*

---

### *1. Introduction (2 marks)*

*Vue.js* is a *progressive JavaScript framework* used to build *interactive user interfaces (UIs)* and *single-page applications (SPAs). It focuses on the **view layer*, making it lightweight and easy to integrate with other libraries.

*Vuex* is the *official state management library* for Vue.js applications. It helps manage and share data across multiple components in a *centralized and predictable way*, similar to Redux in React.

Together, *Vue.js + Vuex* form a complete framework for building powerful, reactive, and maintainable web applications.

---

### *2. Definition (1 mark)*

* *Vue.js:*
  A *JavaScript framework* for building dynamic, component-based, and reactive web interfaces.

* *Vuex:*
  A *state management pattern and library* for Vue.js applications that provides a centralized store to manage the state of all components.

---

### *3. Vue.js Architecture (2 marks)*

Vue.js uses a *Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM)* architecture:

* *Model:* Represents application data.
* *View:* The HTML template displayed to the user.
* *ViewModel:* Vue instance that connects the Model and View through *data binding* and *reactivity*.

*Key Features of Vue.js:*

* Declarative rendering using template syntax.
* Two-way data binding (v-model).
* Component-based structure.
* Virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
* Directives like v-if, v-for, v-bind.

---

### *4. Vuex Architecture (3 marks)*

Vuex is built on the concept of a *single source of truth, providing predictable state management. It has **four key components*:

1. *State:*

   * The single object that holds all shared data in the application.

2. *Getters:*

   * Used to access and compute derived state from the store.

3. *Mutations:*

   * Synchronous functions that modify the state.

4. *Actions:*

   * Handle asynchronous operations (like API calls) and commit mutations.

### *6. Working Example (2 marks)*

For example, in a *Vue shopping cart application*:

* The user clicks “Add to Cart” → *Action* is dispatched.
* The *Action* commits a *Mutation* to update the cart count.
* The *State* updates with new cart data.
* Vue.js automatically re-renders the *View* to show the updated cart.

---

### *7. Advantages (1 mark)*

*Advantages of Vue.js and Vuex:*

* Easy to learn and lightweight.
* Reactive and component-based design.
* Predictable state management with Vuex.
* Great tooling (Vue DevTools).
* Reusable, maintainable, and scalable code structure.

---

### *8. Disadvantages (1 mark)*

* Learning curve for large applications using Vuex.
* Too much boilerplate in Vuex setup.
* Smaller community compared to React/Angular (though growing rapidly).

---

### *9. Conclusion (1 mark)*

*Vue.js* provides the foundation for creating responsive, modular front-end applications, while *Vuex* manages shared data in a consistent and scalable way.
Together, they form a *powerful framework* for building complex, reactive web applications with clear data flow and maintainable architecture.
