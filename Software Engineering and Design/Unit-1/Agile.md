## üåÄ **AGILE PROCESS (15 Marks)**

### **Definition**

Any **agile software process** is characterized in a manner that addresses a number of key assumptions about the majority of software projects:

---

### **Key Assumptions**

1. It is difficult to predict in advance which software requirements will persist and which will change.
   It is equally difficult to predict how customer priorities will change as the project proceeds.

2. For many types of software, **design and construction are interleaved**.
   That is, both activities should be performed in tandem so that design models are proven as they are created.
   It is difficult to predict how much design is necessary before construction is used to prove the design.

3. **Analysis, design, construction, and testing** are not as predictable from a planning point of view.

---

### **Process Adaptability**

Given these three assumptions, an important question arises:
üëâ *How do we create a process that can manage unpredictability?*

The answer lies in **process adaptability**.

To accomplish incremental adaptation, an **agile team requires customer feedback**.
An effective catalyst for customer feedback is an **operational prototype** or a **portion of an operational system**.

Hence, an **incremental development strategy** should be instituted.

---

### **Incremental Development**

* Software increments must be delivered in **short time periods** so that adaptation keeps pace with unpredictability.
* This **iterative approach** enables the customer to evaluate the software increment regularly and provide necessary feedback to the software team.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **AGILITY PRINCIPLES**

**12 Agility Principles for those who want to achieve agility:**

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer‚Äôs competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and good design enhances agility.
10. **Simplicity** ‚Äî the art of maximizing the amount of work not done ‚Äî is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self‚Äìorganizing teams**.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### **Note:**

Not every agile process model applies these 12 principles with equal weight, and some models choose to ignore (or at least downplay) the importance of one or more of the principles.
However, the principles define an **agile spirit** that is maintained in each of the process models.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **The Politics of Agile Development**

There has been considerable debate about the benefits and applicability of agile software development as opposed to a more conventional software engineering process.

It is characterized by the following:

* **Agilists** represent the feeling of the **pro-agility camp**.
* **Traditional methodologists** are a bunch of stick-in-the-muds.
* Like all software technology arguments, it is a **religious war** based on debate risks degenerating.
* No one is against agility.
* Many agile concepts are simply **adaptations of good software engineering concepts**.
