Each **loop (spiral)** represents one **phase** of software development.
The **radius** of the spiral indicates **cost** and **progress**,
while the **angle** represents **risk and iteration**.

---

### **Explanation**

The **Spiral Model** is an **evolutionary software process model** that combines the **iterative nature of prototyping** with the **systematic aspects of the Waterfall Model**.

It is a **risk-driven process model**, focusing on continuous refinement through repeated cycles (spirals).

---

### **🔹 Key Features**

1. **Cyclic & Evolutionary Nature**

   * Software evolves through multiple iterations (spirals).
   * Each iteration increases definition and decreases risk.

2. **Anchor Point Milestones**

   * Set of checkpoints that ensure stakeholder commitment and feasibility.

3. **Risk Analysis**

   * At every loop, risks are identified, analyzed, and mitigated before proceeding.

4. **Customer Feedback**

   * At the end of each spiral, customer feedback helps refine the next iteration.

---

### **🔹 Phases in Each Spiral**

1. **Communication** → Requirements gathering and understanding.
2. **Planning** → Estimation, scheduling, and risk analysis.
3. **Modeling** → System analysis and design.
4. **Construction** → Coding and testing.
5. **Deployment** → Delivery and feedback collection.

Each spiral iteration results in a **more complete version** of the product — from prototype to final system.

---

### **🔹 Characteristics**

* Combines prototyping flexibility with the structure of Waterfall.
* Handles **risk analysis** at every stage.
* Suitable for large, complex, and high-risk projects.
* Continuous evolution until the final product is achieved.

---

### **🔹 Advantages**

✅ High focus on **risk management**.
✅ Ideal for **large and mission-critical systems**.
✅ Supports **continuous customer feedback**.
✅ Allows **incremental addition of features**.
✅ Offers **strong documentation and control**.

---

### **🔹 Disadvantages**

❌ **Expensive** due to continuous analysis and review.
❌ Requires **highly skilled risk analysts**.
❌ Not suitable for **small or low-budget projects**.
❌ Success depends heavily on the **risk analysis phase**.

---

### **🔹 When to Use Spiral Model**

* When **costs and risks** must be carefully evaluated.
* When **requirements are unclear or evolving**.
* For **medium to high-risk** projects.
* For **long-term development** where priorities may change.
* When **research and exploration** are needed.
* For **new product lines** or systems with **significant changes expected**.

### **🔹 Summary**

| Aspect         | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Type** | Risk-driven, evolutionary                                  |
| **Approach**   | Iterative and incremental                                  |
| **Key Focus**  | Risk analysis and customer feedback                        |
| **Outcome**    | Progressively refined software through multiple iterations |

---

**In short:**

> The Spiral Model provides a **realistic and risk-aware framework** for developing large and complex software systems through iterative refinement, integrating customer feedback at every step.
