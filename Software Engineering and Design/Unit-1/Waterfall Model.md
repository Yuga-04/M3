**Explanation:**

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis:**

   * Collect and analyze all system requirements.
   * Determine feasibility and document requirements.
   * No next phase begins until this is complete.

2. **System Design:**

   * Define software architecture, components, interfaces, and data structures.
   * Create detailed design documents for implementation.

3. **Implementation:**

   * Translate design into source code.
   * Developers write code according to design specifications.

4. **Testing:**

   * Conduct software testing to identify defects.
   * Verify that the system meets requirements.
   * Testing begins only after full implementation.

5. **Deployment of System:**

   * Install the software in the user environment.
   * Provide user training and support.

6. **Maintenance:**

   * Fix bugs, update features, and enhance performance.
   * Ensure long-term usability and stability.

**Advantages:**

* Simple and easy to understand and manage.
* Each phase has specific deliverables and review checkpoints.
* Phases are sequential, avoiding overlap.
* Works well for small projects with clear requirements.

**Disadvantages:**

* Difficult to make changes once a phase is completed.
* No working software until the end of the lifecycle.
* High risk and uncertainty.
* Poor choice for complex or long-term projects.
* Not suitable when requirements may change.

**Usage Conditions:**

* Requirements are well-defined, clear, and fixed.
* Technology is understood, and the project is small.
* Minimal customer interaction during development.
* High cost of fixing issues after deployment.
