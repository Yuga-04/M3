## **Various Levels of Testing for Conventional Software**

Software testing is carried out in different levels to ensure that the entire system works correctly.
Each level focuses on specific objectives and helps identify different types of errors.

---

### **1. Unit Testing**

* Tests the **smallest unit or module** of the software.
* Focuses on **internal logic, data structures, and control flow**.
* Ensures that each function or module performs as expected.
* Performed by **developers** using **drivers and stubs**.
* Helps detect and fix errors early in the development phase.

---

### **2. Integration Testing**

* Combines tested modules and checks their **interaction**.
* The main goal is to verify that **interfaces between modules** work correctly.
* Conducted **after unit testing**.

**Approaches:**

* **Top-down integration:** Testing starts from top-level modules and moves downward.

* **Bottom-up integration:** Testing starts from lower modules and moves upward.

* **Big-bang integration:** All modules are combined and tested at once.

* Detects **interface and data flow errors**.

---

### **3. Validation Testing**

* Ensures that the software **meets user requirements and expectations**.
* Focuses on overall **functionality** and **behavior** of the system.
* Involves techniques such as **Black-box testing** and **Acceptance testing**.
* Conducted by **testers or end-users**.
* Confirms that the **product built is the product desired by the user**.

---

### **4. System Testing**

* Tests the **entire integrated software system** as a whole.
* Verifies that all components and subsystems function together properly.
* Includes different types of tests such as:

  * **Performance Testing:** Checks speed and efficiency.
  * **Stress Testing:** Tests behavior under heavy load.
  * **Security Testing:** Ensures data protection.
  * **Recovery Testing:** Checks how well the system recovers from failures.
* Performed in an environment similar to **real-world use**.

---

### **5. Regression Testing**

* **Re-executes** previously conducted test cases after modifications.
* Ensures new changes have not affected existing functionality.
* Maintains software **stability and reliability** after updates.

---

### **6. Acceptance Testing**

* Conducted by **end users or clients** before final delivery.
* Ensures the system satisfies all **business and user requirements**.
* It is the **final stage before deployment**.

**Types:**

* **Alpha Testing:** Done by users at the developer’s site.
* **Beta Testing:** Done by users at their own site with real data.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Each level of testing has a **specific purpose** — from checking small units to validating the full system.
Together, these levels help ensure that the software is **error-free, reliable, and meets user needs** before release.
