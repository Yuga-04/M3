## **SYSTEM TESTING**

### **Definition:**

System testing is the **testing of the complete integrated software system** to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.
It verifies that all components and subsystems work together as a whole.

---

### **Purpose:**

* To validate the **overall functionality and performance** of the entire system.
* To ensure the software behaves correctly under real-world conditions.
* To confirm that all modules, interfaces, and subsystems work together properly.

---

### **Objectives of System Testing:**

* To test both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
* To check the system’s **reliability, security, and performance**.
* To detect defects that may occur due to module interaction or integration.
* To ensure the system meets **user and business expectations** before delivery.

---

### **Features of System Testing:**

* Conducted **after integration testing**.
* Tests are based on the **system specification and user requirements**.
* Involves both **black-box** and **white-box** testing techniques.
* Performed in an environment similar to the **actual user environment**.
* Conducted by an **independent testing team** rather than the developers.

---

### **Types of System Testing:**

1. **Recovery Testing:**

   * Checks how well the system can recover from crashes, hardware failures, or data loss.

2. **Security Testing:**

   * Ensures that data and resources are protected from unauthorized access.

3. **Stress Testing:**

   * Tests the system’s behavior under extreme or heavy loads.

4. **Performance Testing:**

   * Evaluates the system’s speed, response time, and efficiency.

5. **Usability Testing:**

   * Ensures that the system is easy to use and user-friendly.

6. **Compatibility Testing:**

   * Checks if the software works correctly on different hardware, operating systems, and network environments.

---

### **Advantages of System Testing:**

* Ensures that the entire software product works as intended.
* Detects errors missed during earlier testing phases.
* Validates both functional and non-functional aspects.
* Builds confidence before final delivery to the customer.

---

### **Disadvantages:**

* Time-consuming and requires more resources.
* Complex setup similar to a real-time environment.
* Difficult to identify the root cause of errors when they appear at the system level.

---

### **Conclusion:**

System testing is a **critical phase** that verifies the **complete behavior of the software system**.
It ensures that the final product is **reliable, efficient, secure, and ready for delivery** to the end user.
