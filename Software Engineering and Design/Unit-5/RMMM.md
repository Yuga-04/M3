## *Q6. Explain Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management (RMMM). (13 Marks)*

---

### *Definition:*

*Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management (RMMM)* is a systematic approach used in software project management to *identify, reduce, observe, and respond* to risks throughout the software development life cycle.
It ensures that potential problems are *prevented, detected early, or handled effectively* when they occur.

An effective *RMMM strategy* considers *three main issues:*

1. *Risk Avoidance (Mitigation)*
2. *Risk Monitoring*
3. *Risk Management & Contingency Planning*

---

### *1. Risk Avoidance (Mitigation)*

* The *goal* is to *prevent risks from occurring* or *reduce their impact* before they happen.
* This is achieved through a *proactive risk mitigation plan*.

*Example – Staff Turnover Risk:*
To mitigate the risk of losing key team members:

* Meet with staff to identify causes of turnover (e.g., poor environment, low salary).
* Address controllable causes before the project begins.
* Assume some turnover will happen and ensure project continuity by:

  * Cross-training team members.
  * Maintaining good documentation.
  * Distributing critical knowledge among the team.

✅ *Outcome:* Reduces the probability or impact of risk occurrence.

---

### *2. Risk Monitoring*

* Begins *as soon as the project starts* and continues throughout its lifecycle.
* It involves *tracking risk indicators* to determine whether a risk is increasing or decreasing in likelihood.

*Activities in Risk Monitoring:*

1. Observe risk-related parameters (e.g., schedule delays, defect rates, staff morale).
2. Verify that *risk mitigation steps* are effectively implemented.
3. Collect and analyze data for *future risk analysis and improvement*.

✅ *Objective:* Detect risks early and ensure mitigation actions are working.

---

### *3. Risk Management and Contingency Planning*

* Assumes that *mitigation has failed* and the risk has become a *reality*.
* The *goal* is to *minimize the damage* and *recover quickly*.
* A *contingency plan* is a predefined set of actions to be executed when a specific risk occurs.

*Example:*
If a critical module developer leaves:

* Activate backup developer training.
* Reassign tasks temporarily.
* Revise schedule to maintain project flow.

✅ *Outcome:* Ensures project continuity with minimal disruption.

---

### *Pareto Principle in Risk Management (80–20 Rule):*

* In large projects, *80% of the total risk impact* is usually caused by *20% of the identified risks*.
* Focus most resources and attention on the *critical 20%* high-impact risks.

---

### *Software Safety and Hazard Analysis:*

* A *quality assurance activity* focused on identifying *potential hazards* in software that could cause *system failure or harm*.
* Helps ensure system reliability and safety, especially in *embedded or mission-critical systems*.

---

### *The RMMM Plan:*

* The *RMMM Plan* is a formal document (or a section in the project plan) describing how risks are *mitigated, monitored, and managed*.
* It records all risk-related work done during risk analysis and serves as a *reference* throughout the project.

*Contents of an RMMM Plan:*

1. List of identified risks.
2. Risk probability and impact levels.
3. Mitigation strategies for each risk.
4. Monitoring approach and indicators.
5. Contingency actions (if the risk occurs).

*Alternate Approach:*

* Some teams maintain a *Risk Information Sheet (RIS)* instead of a full RMMM document.
* RIS is stored in a *risk database* allowing:

  * Easy risk creation and updates.
  * Priority ordering.
  * Search and analysis.

---

### *Objectives of Risk Monitoring (as part of RMMM):*

1. Assess whether predicted risks actually occur.
2. Ensure that aversion steps are properly applied.
3. Collect data for continuous improvement in future projects.
