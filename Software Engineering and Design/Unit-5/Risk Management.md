## *Q5. Risk Management in Software Engineering (13 Marks)*

### *(a) Definition and Approaches (5 Marks)*

*Risk:*
Risk is the possibility of suffering loss due to uncertainty in project outcomes. It denotes the potential problem that may cause deviation from planned results.

*Risk Management:*
Risk management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risks. It involves evaluating potential threats and planning strategies to minimize their impact on project success.

*Reactive Risk Management:*

* Risks are handled only after they occur.
* Actions such as mitigation (preparing extra resources), fix-on-failure (allocating resources after risk occurs), and crisis management are used.
* Example: Fixing design issues only after system failure.

*Proactive Risk Management:*

* Involves early identification and analysis of potential risks before they occur.
* Root causes are corrected using TQM and SQA practices.
* Example: Identifying unstable requirements early to avoid schedule overruns.

### *(b) Types of Software Risks (4 Marks)*

1. *Project Risks:*

   * Affect schedule, budget, resources, and requirements.
   * Example: Unrealistic deadlines increasing project cost.

2. *Technical Risks:*

   * Affect quality and timeliness.
   * Example: Using untested technology causing design or maintenance problems.

3. *Business Risks:*

   * Threaten the project’s viability or market success.
   * Types:
     i. Market risk ii. Strategic risk iii. Sales risk iv. Management risk v. Budget risk

4. *Known Risks:*

   * Identified from past experience (predictable) or unexpected (unpredictable).
   * Example: Predictable – poor requirement specs; Unpredictable – sudden staff resignations.

### *(c) Risk Identification and Projection (4 Marks)*

*Risk Identification:*
It involves listing potential risks that threaten the project.
Factors include:

* Product size
* Business impact
* Customer characteristics
* Process definition
* Development environment
* Technology to be built
* Staff experience

*Risk Projection (Estimation):*
It assesses:

1. *Probability (P)* – likelihood of the risk occurring.
2. *Consequence (C)* – impact or cost if it occurs.

Steps:

1. Establish a probability scale (improbable → frequent).
2. Identify possible consequences.
3. Estimate overall impact.
4. Record results in a risk table for prioritization.

*Formula:*
[
RE = P \times C
]
Where *RE* = Risk Exposure, *P* = Probability of occurrence, and *C* = Cost if risk occurs.

*Example:*
If probability (P) = 0.4 and cost (C) = ₹50,000, then
[
RE = 0.4 \times 50,000 = ₹20,000
]
Hence, ₹20,000 is the expected potential loss.
