## **Software Requirement Specification (SRS) – 15 Marks**

### **Definition:**

A **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** is the **official document** that states what is required from system developers. It provides a **clear, unambiguous description** of **user and system requirements**, defining **WHAT the system should do** rather than **HOW it should be implemented**.

**Key Points:**

* SRS is **not a design document**.
* It serves as a **reference for both users and developers**.
* It ensures **clarity, completeness, and consistency** in system development.

---

### **Purpose of SRS:**

1. **Communicates requirements** between users and developers.
2. Provides a **foundation for system design**.
3. Serves as a **contract** between client and developer.
4. Helps in **system testing and validation**.

---

### **Structure of SRS Document:**

**Generic structure:**

1. **Introduction** – Purpose, scope, definitions.
2. **General description** – Overall system context.
3. **Specific requirements** – Functional and non-functional requirements.
4. **Appendices and Index** – Supporting information and references.

**Detailed structure:**

* Preface
* Introduction
* Glossary
* User requirements definition
* System architecture
* System requirements specification
* System models
* System evolution
* Appendices
* Index

> The content may vary depending on **type of software** and **development approach**.

---

### **Requirements Specification:**

**Process of writing SRS:**

* Documents **user and system requirements**.
* **User requirements**: understandable by non-technical users; include **functional and non-functional requirements**.
* **System requirements**: detailed version for software engineers; describes **external system behavior** and **operational constraints**.
* System requirements should **avoid design details**, but some detail may be unavoidable due to:

  * Subsystem organization
  * Interoperability with existing systems
  * Architectural choices for non-functional requirements

---

### **Specification Techniques:**

**1. Natural Language Specification:**

* Write clear, unambiguous sentences.
* Use consistent **mandatory (‘shall’)** and **desirable (‘should’)** terms.
* Highlight key parts using bold/italic/color.
* Avoid jargon, abbreviations, or acronyms.
* Include **rationale** for each requirement for future changes.

**2. Structured Specifications:**

* Provide standard form for **functional requirements**:

  * Function/entity description
  * Inputs and sources
  * Outputs and destinations
  * Required information for computation
  * Actions to be taken
  * Pre-conditions (before execution)
  * Post-conditions (after execution)
  * Side effects (if any)

---

### **Key Features of SRS:**

* **Completeness:** All required services included.
* **Consistency:** No conflicting requirements.
* **Unambiguous:** Clear to both users and developers.
* **Verifiable:** Each requirement can be tested.
* **Modifiable:** Easy to update when requirements change.

---

**Summary:**
SRS is a **critical document** that bridges the gap between **user expectations and system design**, ensuring that **software is developed correctly, consistently, and efficiently**.

✅ **Keywords covered:** SRS, user requirements, system requirements, functional, non-functional, natural language specification, structured specification, pre/post-conditions, side effects, clarity, completeness, consistency.
