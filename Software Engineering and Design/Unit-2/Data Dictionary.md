## **DATA DICTIONARY AND ANALYSIS MODEL – 15 Marks**

### **1. Data Dictionary:**

A **Data Dictionary** is a repository that stores information about **data items** used in a **DFD (Data Flow Diagram)**. It provides **essential details** to designers and implementers.

**Features of a Data Dictionary:**

| Feature                 | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**                | Identifies the data item                   |
| **Alias**               | Other names or abbreviations used          |
| **Data structure/type** | Type of data (e.g., int, char)             |
| **Description**         | Explains how and why the data is used      |
| **Duration**            | Life span of data (creation to disposal)   |
| **Accuracy**            | Level of precision (high, medium, low)     |
| **Range of values**     | Allowed values for the data item           |
| **Data flows**          | Processes generating or receiving the data |

**Additional points:**

* Supports **data typing, precision, validation, and identification**.
* Useful for **design validation** to ensure requirements are met.
* For **real-time systems**, data may have **timing constraints** to indicate validity duration.

**Advantages:**

1. Mechanism for **name management**.
2. Serves as a **central store of organizational data information**.

### **2. Analysis Model:**

An **Analysis Model** is a set of models representing a system to **validate software requirements**. It combines **text and diagrams** for clarity and review.

**Objectives:**

1. Describe and define **customer requirements**.
2. Establish a basis for **software design**.
3. Define **requirements that can be validated** after system development.

**Types of Analysis Modeling:**

1. **Data Modeling:** Defines **data objects, attributes, and relationships**.
2. **Functional Modeling:** Defines **data flows** and their **transformations** within the system.
3. **Behavioural Modeling:** Shows the **impact of events** on the system.

**Process:**

* Analysis modeling is **iterative**, refined step by step.
* Models are analyzed for **clarity, completeness, and consistency**.

---

**Summary:**

* **Data Dictionary** ensures all **data items are well-defined, typed, and validated**.
* **Analysis Model** provides a **structured, visual, and textual representation** of **requirements**, forming a **foundation for design and verification**.

✅ **Keywords covered:** Data dictionary, DFD, name, alias, type, description, duration, accuracy, range, data flows, timing constraints, analysis model, data modeling, functional modeling, behavioural modeling, clarity, completeness, consistency.
